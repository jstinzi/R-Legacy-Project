Regular expressions are needed for pattern matching

There are different characters used for pattern matching:
Anchors
^ searchs for pattern at start of string
$ searchs for pattern at end of string


. allows for any number of any character
\d searches for a digit - to add to pattern string

In this example, we only want data from genotypes containing
a knockout of the claw gene
```{r}
#Create dataframe
speed <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 3)
genotype <- c(rep("WT", 10),
              rep("white", 10),
              rep("claw", 10),
              rep("thunder", 10),
              rep("struck", 10),
              rep("white claw", 10),
              rep("thunder claw", 10),
              rep("thunder struck", 10),
              rep("claw struck", 10),
              rep("white claw thunder", 10))
data <- data.frame(cbind(genotype, speed))
data$speed <- as.numeric(data$speed)
data$speed <- round(data$speed, digits = 2)

#let's try to get just the data with a claw variant of the genotype
claw_data <- data[data$genotype %in% grep(pattern = "claw",
                                        data$genotype,
                                        value = TRUE), ]

#now let's try to get just genotypes where claw is at the end
claw_data_2 <- data[data$genotype %in% grep(pattern = "claw$",
                                        data$genotype,
                                        value = TRUE), ]

#now let's try to get just genotypes where claw is at the beginning
claw_data_3 <- data[data$genotype %in% grep(pattern = "^claw",
                                        data$genotype,
                                        value = TRUE), ]

#now let's try to get just genotypes where claw is in the middle

#save this example
claw_data_4 <- data[data$genotype %in% grep(pattern = "white.{+}thunder",
                                        data$genotype,
                                        value = TRUE), ]

#now let's try to get speed values that are double-digits, with a
#5 in the first decimal place
claw_data_5 <- data[data$speed %in% grep(pattern = "^\\d\\d.5",
                                        data$speed,
                                        value = TRUE), ]
#now let's get single-digit speed values
claw_data_6 <- data[data$speed %in% grep(pattern = "^\\d\\.",
                                        data$speed,
                                        value = TRUE), ]
#note that for some punctuation, you need to use a \\ beforehand
