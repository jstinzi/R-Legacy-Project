Here we will use the built-in functions from R to generate a random
dataset according to the needs of a specific type of analysis. To
find what kinds of distributions are available, type ?Distributions
into the command line. In general, to randomly sample from a
distribution, you need to type r with the distribution name. For
example, rnorm and rbeta simulate normal and beta distributions.

When randomly sampling for a dataset to test analyses, it may be
necessary to specify a given distribution so that you can get random
data similar to that which you will collect. The power of random
datasets is that you can build your analysis in advance of data
collection (or build it while a machine is collecting data), saving
time later!

```{r}
#Set seed to make the randomness repeatable
set.seed(9)
#Let's create a series of vectors simulating differences in two
#populations by randomly sampling a normal distribution, with
#corresponding vectors sampled from a uniform distribution that will
#represent the dependent variables in a multiple regression analysis.

#Create vector for treatments
treatments <- c(rep("A", 100), rep("B", 100))

#Create randomly sampled normal vector of height
height <- c(rnorm(n = 100, mean = 180, sd = 20), 
            rnorm(n = 100, mean = 150, sd = 15))

#Create randomly sampled vectors for some hypothetical predictors
white_claw_consumption <- c(rchisq(n = 100, df = 10, ncp = 20),
                            rchisq(n = 100, df = 5, ncp = 5))
hist(white_claw_consumption)
pizza_consumption <- runif(n = 200, min = 0, max = 3)
kickball_play_time <- runif(n = 200, min = 0, max = 20)

#Collate to dataframe
data <- data.frame(treatments, height, white_claw_consumption,
                   pizza_consumption, kickball_play_time)
plot(height ~ white_claw_consumption, data)

model <- lm(height ~ treatments + white_claw_consumption + 
             pizza_consumption + kickball_play_time, data)
plot(model)
summary(model)
t.test(height ~ treatments, data)

library(nlme)
model_2 <- lme(height ~ white_claw_consumption,
             random = ~1|treatments, data)
summary(model_2)

#Based on the plot, we would expect a significant regression
#between white claw consumption and height, but when we
#account for the treatments, there are no differences!
