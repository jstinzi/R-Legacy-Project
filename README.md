# R-Legacy-Project
A resource designed for teaching working proficiency in R coding. The goal of this workshop is to
equip attendees with the tools needed to teach R to others. In the process, attendees will learn
R to an advanced level (for biologists), creating a foundation from which they can rapidly
incoporated new techniques in R into their coding repertoire.

This project is currently being piloted at the University of New Mexico, with 1.5 hr lessons run on a
bi-weekly basis, with a small group (4 attendees + 1 instructor).

1. Principles of clean & transparent coding
2. R projects, version control through git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop
3. Using R markdown for troubleshooting code

## Week 2
