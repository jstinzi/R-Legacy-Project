# R-Legacy-Project
A resource designed for teaching working proficiency in R coding. The goal of this workshop is to
equip attendees with the tools needed to teach R to others. In the process, attendees will learn
R to an advanced level (for biologists), creating a foundation from which they can rapidly
incoporated new techniques in R into their coding repertoire.

This project is currently being piloted at the University of New Mexico, with 1.5 hr lessons run 
on a bi-weekly basis, with a small group (4 attendees + 1 instructor). While this workshop assumes
a base level of proficiency, complementary resources to achieve that base proficiency are available
in another repository (https://github.com/jstinzi/R-UNM-Biology-Workshop).
