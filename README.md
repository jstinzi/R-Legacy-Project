# R-Legacy-Project
A resource designed for teaching working proficiency in R coding. The goal of this workshop is to
equip attendees with the tools needed to teach R to others. In the process, attendees will learn
R to an advanced level (for biologists), creating a foundation from which they can rapidly
incoporated new techniques in R into their coding repertoire.
