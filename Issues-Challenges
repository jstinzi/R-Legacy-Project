#Issues and Challenges in R
As issues arise throughout the workshop, please write about the issue or challenge.
Provide a description with example code, and if you solved it, what you did to solve
it.

Example Issue: 
Issue: {unite} function from {tidyr} stopped working in a script.

Code: data <- unite(data, col = "ID", from = c("Treatment", "Plant"), sep = "_")

Solution: In {tidyr}'s latest update, the 'from' argument name was removed. To fix,
simply remove 'from =' from the code.

data <- unite(data, col = "ID", c("Treatment", "Plant"), sep = "_")
